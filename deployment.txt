To merge changes from your main branch into your gh-pages branch and deploy them, follow these steps:

Step 1: Switch to gh-pages Branch
First, make sure youâ€™re on the gh-pages branch:

git checkout gh-pages


Step 2: Merge Changes from main
Next, merge the changes from the main branch into the gh-pages branch:

git merge main


Step 3: Resolve Conflicts (if any)
If there are any merge conflicts, Git will notify you. You'll need to resolve these conflicts manually. After resolving, stage the changes:

git add .


Step 4: Commit the Merge
After resolving conflicts, commit the merge:

git commit -m "Merge changes from main into gh-pages"
Step 5: Push the Changes to GitHub
Now push your changes to the gh-pages branch:

git push origin gh-pages


revert last commit
git reset --hard HEAD~1

check all branches
git branch -a

create branch 
git branch branch main

Option 3: Revert a Specific Commit (Safest Option)
If you want to undo the effects of the last commit while preserving it in the history, you can use the git revert command:

git revert HEAD
